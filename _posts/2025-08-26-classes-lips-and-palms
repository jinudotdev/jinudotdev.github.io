I reorganized the code to bring in classes.

I will use lips and palms to track whether the user is brushing their teeth or not

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/images/2025-08-26.png" alt="Lips and Palm" width="400">
  <p><em>Brush will be determined by lips and palms</em></p>
</div>

I come from a java background so I'm still trying to get a hang of python
