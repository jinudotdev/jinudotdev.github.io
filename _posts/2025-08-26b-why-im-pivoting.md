I started this project to familiarize myself with python (I come from a java background, plus it has been a long
time since I had been coding), use tools like hand tracking and UI overlays. I'm glad I was able to once again 
get back to my love for modular programing and clean code. 

However, there were times when I thought that I was wasting too much time debugging silly things that I was just 
not interested in, such as the continuity camera issue when I'm using my macair's camera. My end goal is to learn
machine learning and beyond, and trying to debug a camera issue seemed like a misuse of my time. 

I am grateful to have learned so much from this project. This was the biggest python project to date, and I was able
to create objects in python, as well as apply dictionaries, lists, and tuples. I was able to use libraries like
MediaPipe for identifying objects in real time, and these concepts may come into use later. 

My next project will be geared more towards data analysis. Pandas, Matplotlib, etc. I will take what I learned from
here, use clean, modular code and apply it towards something exciting and new.
