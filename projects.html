  <h2>RoastMaster</h2>
  <p>
    RoastMaster is a tool designed for a 540‑lb Probat/Burns roaster that uses a custom program to operate by inputting temperature & fuel % (not time) in nine stages. My python code with an optional GUI uses logged roast data and a CatBoost model to improve consistency by using previous environmental and bean‑related data.
