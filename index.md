Welcome to my dev log. I’m building modular grip detection and overlay systems for Brush Hero.

### 🧪 Current Status
- Grip detection refactored (thumb-index proximity)
- Overlay rendering centralized
- Face + hand overlays integrated

### 🛠️ Next Steps
- Transition logging
- Naming cleanup
- Wrist rotation tolerance
