</div>

I roast coffee by day and build oddly specific software by night. This site is where I log my dev experiments—grip detection, overlay managers, ergonomic workflows, and whatever else I end up chasing.

I’m here to learn out loud, reflect when things break, and share the process in case it helps someone else.

BrushHero is the current obsession, but it won’t be the last. Stick around if you like modular code, semantic naming debates, and watching someone wrestle with real-time pipelines in public.
