I've taken up a hobby as a developer, architecting tools that see, respond, and adapt. This site is my dev log: a place to document experiments, debug logic, and share architectural pivots as I build systems that go beyond the screen.

Whether it's grip detection for BrushHero, overlay managers for real-time vision, or ergonomic workflows across platforms, I’m chasing clarity, modularity, and maintainability. I believe good code should teach, adapt, and leave room for the next idea.

This space will grow with me. Expect sketches, refactors, and reflections—not just polished outcomes.

Thanks for stopping by.
